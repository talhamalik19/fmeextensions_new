                <h2>How to Implement Multiple Select Checkboxes in Magento 2 Layered Navigation?</h2>
                <p>Implementing multiple select checkboxes in Magento 2 layered navigation involves several steps. Here is a high-level overview of the process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, you need to ensure that the attributes you want to enable multiple select checkboxes for are properly configured. In the Magento admin panel, navigate to "Stores"  "Attributes" "Product." Locate the attribute you want to modify and edit its settings. Enable the "Use in Layered Navigation" option and set the "Filterable (with results)" option to "Multiple Select."</li>
                    <li>Once the attributes are configured, go to "Stores" "Configuration" "Catalog" "Catalog" "Layered Navigation." Set the "Display Multiple Values as" option to "Multiple Select." Save the configuration changes.</li>
                    <li>After making the configuration changes, it's essential to reindex the data to update the layered navigation index. In the Magento admin panel, go to "System" "Index Management." Select the relevant indexes (such as "Product Attributes," "Category Products," etc.) and click on "Reindex" from the Actions dropdown menu.</li>
                    <li>Clear the Magento cache to ensure that the changes take effect. Go to "System" "Cache Management" and click on "Flush Magento Cache."</li>
                    <li>Finally, navigate to the frontend of your Magento 2 store and go to a category page that includes the attributes with multiple select checkboxes. You should now see the attributes displayed with checkboxes that allow users to select multiple options simultaneously.</li>
